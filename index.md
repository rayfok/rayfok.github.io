I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Daniel Weld</a>. My research blends principles from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on <b>developing intelligent, interactive systems for supporting and augmenting complex knowledge work</b>. My recent work explores applications across scholarly communication and sensemaking, workplace productivity, and AI-assisted decision making.

Throughout my PhD, I've been fortunate to collaborate with researchers at AI2 (<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/about">Semantic Scholar</a>), <a href="https://research.adobe.com/research/document-intelligence/">Adobe Research</a>, and <a href="">Google Research</a>. Prior to joining UW, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor, where I worked on crowdsourcing and mixed-initiative systems.
