I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Daniel Weld</a>. My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). **I build systems to augment human intelligence on complex tasks.** My recent work explores applications spanning scientific research, knowledge worker productivity, and human-AI decision making.

I've previously interned at AI2 (<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/about">Semantic Scholar</a>), <a href="https://research.adobe.com/research/document-intelligence/">Adobe Research</a>, and Google Research. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Michigan, where I worked on crowdsourcing and hybrid intelligence systems.

**Research Interests**: HCI, Human-AI Interaction, Scholarly Communication, Explainable AI
