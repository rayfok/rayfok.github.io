I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Daniel Weld</a>. My research lies at the interaction of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Currently, my work aims to understand how technological interventions can intelligently and seamlessly augment scholarly communication.

I collaborate frequently with the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/about">Semantic Scholar</a> research team at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and have also previously interned at Adobe Research (<a href="https://research.adobe.com/research/document-intelligence/">Document Intelligence</a>) and Google Research (Gboard, Accessibility). In a past life, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Michigan, where I worked on crowdsourcing methods and hybrid intelligence workflows.

__Research Interests__: Human-Computer Interaction, Applications of AI for Scholarly Documents, Explainable AI
