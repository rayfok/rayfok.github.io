## About Me

I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Dan Weld</a>. My research builds on ideas from both Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing. My recent interests include exploring 1) how explanations influence AI-advised decision making, and 2) AI applications for interactive document exploration.

Throughout my PhD, I have collaborated frequently with the Semantic Scholar team at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2). I have also previously spent time at Google Research working on mobile accessibility and modeling mobile interaction. For Summer 2023, I will be at Adobe Research on the Document Intelligence team, investigating user-centered multi-document exploration with large language models.

## Research Interests

- **Human-Computer Interaction:** XAI for decision-making, design of intelligent tools to support scholars
- **Natural Language Processing:** long-form document understanding, science QA, LLMs for science writing
