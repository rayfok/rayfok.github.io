I am a final year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Daniel Weld</a>. My research interests lies at the intersection of HCI and AI, with a focus on designing, developing, and evaluating augmented intelligence systems for enhancing knowledge work. My recent works span applications across scholarly communication, workplace productivity, and AI-assisted decision making.

Throughout my PhD, I've been fortunate to collaborate with researchers at AI2 (<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/about">Semantic Scholar</a>), <a href="https://research.adobe.com/research/document-intelligence/">Adobe Research</a>, and Google Research. Prior to joining UW, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor, where I worked on crowdsourcing and mixed-initiative systems.
