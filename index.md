I am a Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft (MSAI), working on post-training for enterprise M365 Copilot.<br>
I received my Ph.D. from the University of Washington (Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering), where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Daniel Weld</a> as a member of the <a href="https://hai.cs.washington.edu/">Lab for Human-AI Interaction</a>.
<!-- My research blends principles from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on <span style="font-weight: 600">developing intelligent, interactive systems for supporting and augmenting complex knowledge work</span>. My recent work explores applications across scholarly communication and sensemaking, enterprise productivity, and AI-assisted decision making. -->
During my Ph.D., I worked on human-centered AI applications for scientific communication, sensemaking, and synthesis, collaborating with researchers at <a href="https://allenai.org/">Ai2</a> (<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/about">Semantic Scholar</a>), <a href="https://research.adobe.com/research/document-intelligence/">Adobe Research</a>, and <a href="">Google Research</a>.

<!-- Prior to joining UW, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor, where I worked on crowdsourcing and mixed-initiative systems. -->
