I am a final year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Daniel Weld</a>. I work at the intersection of HCI and AI, with a focus on designing and building novel AI-enabled interaction techniques that empower human intelligence on complex knowledge work.** My recent work spans applications across scholarly communication, workplace productivity, and human-AI decision making.

I've previously collaborated with AI2 (<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/about">Semantic Scholar</a>), <a href="https://research.adobe.com/research/document-intelligence/">Adobe Research</a>, and Google Research. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Michigan, where I worked on crowdsourcing and hybrid intelligence systems.

**Research Areas**: HCI, Human-AI Interaction, Scholarly Communication, Explainable AI
