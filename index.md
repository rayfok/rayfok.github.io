I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Daniel Weld</a>. My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), focused on the development of user interfaces and computational methods to augment human intelligence on complex tasks. My recent work spans support for scientific research, knowledge worker productivity, and trustworthy decision making.

I collaborate frequently with the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/about">Semantic Scholar</a> research team at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and have also previously interned at Adobe Research (<a href="https://research.adobe.com/research/document-intelligence/">Document Intelligence</a>) and Google Research. Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Michigan, where I worked on crowdsourcing methods and hybrid intelligence systems.

__Research Interests__: Human-Computer Interaction, Applications of AI for Science, Explainable AI
